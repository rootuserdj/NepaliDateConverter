# NepaliDateConverter
 a library to convert English (Gregorian) dates to Nepali (Bikram Sambat) dates involves a bit of research and understanding of the differences between the two calendar systems. Hereâ€™s a basic implementation in Python to get you started.


# Step 1: Understanding the Calendar System
The Bikram Sambat calendar is a solar calendar used in Nepal and some parts of India. It is roughly 56.7 years ahead of the Gregorian calendar. The exact conversion can be complex due to differences in month lengths and leap years.

# Step 2: Basic Implementation
We can create a basic library that includes a method for converting a Gregorian date to a Bikram Sambat date.

# Create a nepali_date_converter.py file:

    BS_YEAR_START = 1970
    BS_MONTH_START = 1
    BS_DAY_START = 1
    BS_YEAR_END = 2100
    
    BS = [
        [0, 30, 32, 31, 32, 31, 30, 29, 30, 29, 31, 30, 30],  # 1970
        [0, 31, 32, 31, 32, 31, 30, 29, 30, 29, 31, 30, 30],
        # Add more years as needed
    ]
    
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def is_leap_year(self, year):
        return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
    
    def gregorian_to_nepali(self, year, month, day):
        diff_year = 56
        diff_month = 8
        diff_day = 17

        # Nepali year
        np_year = year + diff_year

        # Nepali month
        if month <= 4:
            np_year -= 1
            np_month = month + 8
        else:
            np_month = month - 4

        # Nepali day
        np_day = day + diff_day
        if np_day > 30:
            np_month += 1
            np_day -= 30

        if np_month > 12:
            np_year += 1
            np_month -= 12

        return np_year, np_month, np_day

# Example Usage

        if __name__ == "__main__":
             converter = NepaliDateConverter()
             g_year, g_month, g_day = 2023, 7, 22
             n_year, n_month, n_day = converter.gregorian_to_nepali(g_year, g_month, g_day)
             print(f"Nepali Date: {n_year}-{n_month:02d}-{n_day:02d}")


# Note 

1. The conversion between the Gregorian and Bikram Sambat calendars involves complex calculations. The above implementation is a basic example and might not be accurate. You need to add more accurate data for month lengths and leap years.

2. The conversion logic here is very simplified and should be refined based on accurate calendar data. The exact days per month and leap year calculations for Bikram Sambat must be included to make the library accurate.

   
3. You might need to maintain a dataset of Bikram Sambat months and their respective lengths for each year for accurate conversion.
   
5. You can enhance this basic library by adding methods to convert from Nepali to Gregorian, handle edge cases, validate dates, etc.
